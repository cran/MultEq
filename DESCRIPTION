Description: Equivalence tests and related confidence intervals for the
 comparison of two treatments, simultaneously for one or many normally
 distributed, primary response variables (endpoints). The step-up
 procedure of Quan et al. (2001) is both applied for differences and
 extended to ratios of means. A related single-step procedure is also
 available.
